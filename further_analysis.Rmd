## Lasso regression used in the app
For the application created in this project we used a Lasso regression. In this analysis the dipendent variable is the general rating and as indipendent variables 34 other variables (all the one that could fit for the analysis).
As shown in the table here the regressors that had a higher coefficient were the other ratings that the customer gave to the accomodation: accuracy, communication, check-in and location. We consider those as very relevant regressor so we decided to keep them in our analaysis.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
ny_pre_app <- read_csv("~/Desktop/master/ny_pre_app.csv")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

ny_df_pre_standardization <- select(ny_pre_app, -c('...1','id','neighbourhood_group_cleansed','price_new','lasso_rating'))

# standardization function
standardize_data <- function(x){
  return((x-mean(x))/sd(x))
}
ny_df_standardized <- as.data.frame(apply(ny_df_pre_standardization,2,standardize_data))
summary(ny_df_standardized)
apply(ny_df_standardized,2,sd)    #run these to verify wether the data frame is strandardized

## Running the Lasso

# defining the dependent variable and the regressor matrix
y <- as.vector(ny_df_standardized[,c('review_scores_value')])
X<- select(ny_df_standardized, -c('review_scores_value'))
library(glmnet)
## lasso regression
cv.lasso <- cv.glmnet(as.matrix(X), y, alpha = 1, nfolds=40, grouped=FALSE)
lasso <- glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1, lambda = cv.lasso$lambda.min)
coef(lasso)  ## coefficients

## preparing data for the plot
lasso_rating<-predict(lasso,as.matrix(X))
str(y)
ridge <- glmnet(X, y, alpha = 0, lambda = 1)
coef(lasso)
coef_lasso <- as.numeric(coef(lasso))
d <- colnames(X[])
gg <- append('intercept',d)
lasso_plot <- as.data.frame(coef_lasso)
lasso_plot$d <- gg
colnames(lasso_plot) <- c("lasso_coefficient", "variable_name")
library(ggplot2)
lasso_plot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = variable_name, y = lasso_coefficient)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  labs(title = "Lasso coefficient of each variable",
       x ="Lasso coefficient",
       y = "Variable name") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(color = "grey20", size = 10, angle = 90, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.y = element_text(angle=90,colour = "grey20", size = 10),
        text = element_text (size = 10),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## A new Lasso regression
To allow further interpretation, we decided to run another regression where the ratings that were previously included in the X matrix (the matrix containing the indipent variables) where not included.

This allowed us to notice very interesting facts abo

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
